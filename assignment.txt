Python Classes Assessment
Robot Simulator – Build the Robot Class
Overview
You are given a working simulator program called simulator.py
Your job is to write a file called module.py that contains a class named Robot.
You may NOT modify the simulator file.
Your class must work correctly inside the simulator.

📂 Files
You will have:
 ✅ assignment.txt
A text copy of this document.
✅ test.py (DO NOT EDIT)
This file can be used to quickly test your code. The output should match expected_output.txt.
✅ expected_output.txt (DO NOT EDIT)
This file contains expected text from test.py.
✅ simulator.py (Edits optional)
This file should work by the end of the assignment.
❗ module.py (you must add code to this file)
Complete the Robot class in this file to make everything work.




Objective
Create a class called:
class Robot:
Your class must contain the required properties and methods described below.

🔹 Constructor (__init__)
When a robot is created:
robot = Robot(name, color)
It must initialize the following properties:
Property
Starting Value
self.name
argument passed into __init__
self.color
argument passed into __init__
self.battery
100
self.durability
100
self.productivity
0



Required Methods
Your class must include the following methods:

🔋 charge(amount)
amount will be passed in as a string.
Convert it to an integer inside the method.
Increase battery by the amount.
If the battery would go above 100, set it to 100.
Return string: <name> charged by X.

🛠 work(hours)
hours will be passed in as a string.
Convert it to an integer inside the method.
Decrease battery by hours × 10
Decrease durability by hours × 5
Increase productivity by hours × 8
Return string: <name> worked for X hours.

🔧 repair()
Increase durability by 20
Decrease productivity by 10
Return string: <name> has been repaired.

📊 status()
Return a string formatted exactly like this:
<name> | Battery: X | Durability: Y | Productivity: Z

Spacing and capitalization matter.


🧠 What This Assignment Tests
 ✔ Writing a class from a specification
 ✔ Creating and initializing properties
 ✔ Using and modifying object state
 ✔ Converting input types
 ✔ Writing methods that return formatted strings
 ✔ Enforcing constraints

🏁 Success Criteria
Your program works if:
The simulator runs without crashing


All commands behave correctly


Values stay within limits


Output formatting matches exactly



🌟 Challenge Extension (Extra Credit)
Add logic so that:
If battery would go below 0, the robot cannot work. Print “not enough battery”.

If durability drops below 50, print a warning message.

Any additional features you think of that don’t break the program's core functionality.
